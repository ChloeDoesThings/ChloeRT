# ChloeRT
## What is this?
ChloeRT is a script that can be ran on certain Roblox executors (like Krampus) which can give you a lot of useful information about how the game works. It will come with a RemoteSpy, bytecode disassembler/decompiler, script dumper (gets constants, upvalues, protos, etc.), and maybe more.

## When will this release?
Not sure yet, but hopefully soon.
