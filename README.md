# ChloeRT
## What is this?
ChloeRT is a tool (coded in C#) that allows you to understand bytecode and programs better via reverse engineering.

## What features will it have?
1. A disassembler/decompiler for x86 executable (.exe) and dynamic link library (.dll) files.

2. A Luau bytecode disassembler/decompiler (made specifically for Roblox-generated bytecode).

3. A memory scanner (kinda like Cheat Engine, works when a program is running)

4. A simple DLL injector

## How much will it cost?
It will be completely free and open source.
